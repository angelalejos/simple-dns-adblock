## Web Front End
The web front end "rtgraph.pl" connects to a sqlite database created by "enterstats.pl". It pulls usage statistics for a 24 hour period and plots them using canvas.js. For security and privacy reasons only blocked queries are recorded in the sqlite database.

The "rtgraph.pl" server is a Mojolicious Lite web app that uses JSON to communicate with the JavaScript web app.

You can see an example running on http://opens3.net

### Running the web front end
To run the web front end: 
> su -m nobody -c "hypnotoad rtgraph.pl"

This will run the server as the user nobody. If you want allow connections from the internet use Nginx as a proxy server.

#### Simple windows only version:

Download windnsblock.exe and run as administrator this will use the host file to DNS block the 122k domains in the main Ad Blocker list.

#### To install DNS Server (FreeBSD only):
Install dnsmasq. Enable dnsmasq:
```
sysrc dnsmasq_enable="YES"
sysrc dnsmasq_flags="-R"
```
Create directory /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/ with "nobody:nobody" permissions. 

Place the update_dnsmasq in /usr/local/bin/ (make it executable - chmod +x )

Add the following lines to /etc/crontab:
```
30      5       1       *       *       nobody   update_dnsmasq
30      5       1       *       *       nobody   service dnsmasq restart
```

Create this file (change as neccessary):
usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/simple-dns-block.conf 
```
#Config credit - Pi-Hole
addn-hosts=/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/blocklist.txt

localise-queries

no-resolv

cache-size=10000

log-queries=extra
log-facility=/var/log/sdb.log

#open dns servers - change if needed
server=208.67.222.222
server=208.67.220.220
#change interface to match yours
interface=re1
```
Edit /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf:
```
config-dir="/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/"
```
Run update_dnsmasq:
> su -m nobody -c 'update_dnsmasq'

Check for any errors regarding file permissions.

If there are any make sure /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d is owned by "nobody:nobody".
Start dnsmasq:
> service dnsmasq start
